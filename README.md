## About me
I'm 19 years old BSUIR student. My goal is to continue learning in Java and backend developing, because it always seemed incomprehensible and hidden on the side, but now I can create my own something new. I think now is time to get my first experience and accept the test of real development in a team with the same fire in the eyes. Also I have good soft skills, that can help me to work in team and make my dream come true.
